This project is part of the **UIT Data Science Challenge 2024**, focusing on sarcasm detection in **multimodal data** (text and images).

**Approach**
**1. Text Extraction from Images**

Utilized an OCR model combined with image cropping techniques to enhance text extraction accuracy from images.
**2. Multimodal Embedding with CLIP**

Employed the CLIP model to generate embeddings for both text and images, ensuring a unified representation of multimodal data.
**3. Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection Model**

- Developed a CNN model with Self-Attention to process image, text, and combined image-text embeddings.
- Applied Over-Sampling and Weighted Loss to address class imbalance.
- Implemented K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure model robustness and generalization.
- Used a custom F1-Macro callback to track performance and save the best model for each fold.
**4. Evaluation**

Model performance is evaluated using the F1-macro score due to severe class imbalance. This ensures fair assessment across all labels, preventing the model from favoring majority classes.

Our model consistently ranked 1st place among all teams for over half of the competition's first month, demonstrating its effectiveness in sarcasm detection.
